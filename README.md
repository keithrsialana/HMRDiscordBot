# HMRDiscordBot
Creating a chatbot for a the social platform 'Discord'

## Setup
On the event that the project does not already include the required modules, download these modules.

Note: Some API calls didn't have the option to recieve requests from the request module, so axios was needed to fix this problem.
```
npm install discord.js request axios
```

## Running
Use this from the base folder
```
node .
```
