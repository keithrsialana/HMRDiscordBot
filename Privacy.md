# Ricebot - Privacy Policy
## 1. Introduction
Ricebot is a Discord bot designed for general use, moderation, economy, and fun commands. This Privacy Policy explains how Ricebot handles user data.
## 2. Data Collection
Ricebot only tracks economy balances for each user. If a user is active in multiple servers, their balance is transferable and can be added to existing data. No other personal data is collected, stored, or shared.
## 3. User Consent
By using Ricebot, users agree to this Privacy Policy and consent to how their data is collected, stored, and used as described.
## 4. Data Usage
- Economy balance data is stored to allow users to track their virtual currency across different servers.
- Ricebot does not use collected data for advertising, analytics, or third-party sharing.
- Data is not monitored outside of in-app interactions on Discord.
## 5. Data Sharing
Ricebot does not sell, trade, or share user data with third parties. All economy balance data remains within the bot’s functionality and is not accessible to external services.
## 6. Data Security
Ricebot’s economy balance data is not encrypted, but it can only be accessed by the bot owner. Users should be aware that Discord-based data storage cannot guarantee absolute security.
## 7. Children's Privacy
Ricebot is available to all users, but it does not knowingly collect data from users under 13 years of age. If a parent or guardian believes a child's data has been collected, they may contact the bot owner for assistance.
## 8. Third-Party Services
Ricebot may interact with external APIs or services. While Ricebot ensures minimal data collection, users should review those third-party services’ privacy policies for further information.
## 9. Changes to Privacy Policy
The bot owner reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Since Ricebot is not designed for widespread use, users will not be notified of changes.
## 10. Contact Information
For privacy-related questions or concerns, users may reach out via Direct Message to the bot owner (Discord username: ricekeet).
