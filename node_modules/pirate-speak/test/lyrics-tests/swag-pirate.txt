If me be yer boyfriend, I'd nary let ye sail
me can take ye places ye ain't nary been afore
Baby, take a chance or you'll nary ever know
me got doubloons in me hands that I'd verily like t' blow
Swag, swag, swag, on ye
Chillin' by thar fire while our jolly crew eatin' fondue
me don't know about me but me know about ye
So cry ahoy t' falsetto in three, two, swag
