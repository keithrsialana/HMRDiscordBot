As he came into thar window
It be thar sound o' a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He port thar bloodstains on thar carpet
She ran underneath thar table
He could see she be unable
So she ran into thar bedroom
She be struck down, it be her doom

Annie, be ye ok?
So, Annie be ye ok
Be ye ok, Annie
Annie, be ye ok?
So, Annie be ye ok
Be ye ok, Annie
